        The KSA academic platform aims to optimize educational management by facilitating interaction between students, teachers, and administrators. This project proposes the use of the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) for web development and React Native for the mobile application. The choice of the MERN Stack ensures a scalable and efficient platform, using JavaScript on both the frontend and backend, which speeds up development and integration between the parties.
